## Setting Up
<WIP>
To set this up, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. If you want to use a virtual environment, create a virtual environment prior to running this script.

Additionally, you'll need to add the root directory to your python path. If you're using a virtual environment, in the 'activate.bat' file, manually add the project root to your Python Path. If you're not using a venv, you'll just want to add the root directory to your path.
